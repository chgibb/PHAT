The bdf2gdfont.pl script will convert an X11 BDF font into a bitmapped
font that can be loaded into GD using the GD::Font->load() method.
Some restrictions apply. Run "perldoc bdf2gdfont.pl" for details.

Other scripts in this directory were designed for older versions of
libgd in which the fonts are compiled in.  Please use with care.
