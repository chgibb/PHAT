=head1 NAME

TAP::Harness::Restricted - Skip some test files

=head1 VERSION

version 0.003

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # command line
    $ HARNESS_SUBCLASS=TAP::Harness::Restricted make test

    # bashrc file
    export HARNESS_SUBCLASS=TAP::Harness::Restricted

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is a trivial subclass of L<TAP::Harness>.  It overrides the
C<aggregate_tests> function to filter out tests that I didn't want getting in
the way of module installation.

The current criteria include:

=over 4

=item *

File names that look like F<pod.t> or F<pod-coverage.t>, with optional leading numbers

=item *

Files that contain the text C<use Test::Pod>

=item *

Files matching any of the space-separated glob patterns in C<$ENV{HARNESS_SKIP}>

=back

Suggestions for other annoying things to filter out are welcome.

If someone is inclined to make this extensible so people can put their own criteria into
configuration files, please email the author with ideas before sending a patch.
