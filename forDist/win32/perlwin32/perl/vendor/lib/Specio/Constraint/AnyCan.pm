=head1 NAME

Specio::Constraint::AnyCan - A class for constraints which require a class name or object with a set of methods

=head1 VERSION

version 0.31

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $type = Specio::Constraint::AnyCan->new(...);
    print $_, "\n" for @{ $type->methods };

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a specialized type constraint class for types which require a class
name or object with a defined set of methods.

=head1 API

This class provides all of the same methods as L<Specio::Constraint::Simple>,
with a few differences:

=head2 Specio::Constraint::AnyCan->new( ... )

The C<parent> parameter is ignored if it passed, as it is always set to the
C<Defined> type.

The C<inline_generator> and C<constraint> parameters are also ignored. This
class provides its own default inline generator subroutine reference.

This class overrides the C<message_generator> default if none is provided.

Finally, this class requires an additional parameter, C<methods>. This must be
an array reference of method names which the constraint requires. You can also
pass a single string and it will be converted to an array reference
internally.

=head2 $any_can->methods

Returns an array reference containing the methods this constraint requires.

=head1 ROLES

This class does the L<Specio::Constraint::Role::IsaType>,
L<Specio::Constraint::Role::Interface>, and L<Specio::Role::Inlinable> roles.

=head1 SUPPORT

Bugs may be submitted through L<https://github.com/houseabsolute/Specio/issues>.
