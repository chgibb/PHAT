=head1 NAME

Log::Report::Translator - base implementation for translating messages

=head1 INHERITANCE

 Log::Report::Translator is extended by
   Log::Report::Translator::Gettext
   Log::Report::Translator::POT

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 # internal infrastructure
 my $msg = Log::Report::Message->new(_msgid => "Hello World\n");
 print Log::Report::Translator->new(...)->translate($msg);

 # normal use
 textdomain 'my-domain'
   , translator => Log::Report::Translator->new;  # default
 print __"Hello World\n";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A module (or distribution) has a certain way of translating messages,
usually C<gettext>.  The translator is based on some C<textdomain>
for the message, which can be specified as option per text element,
but usually is package scoped.

This base class does not translate at all: it will use the MSGID
(and MSGID_PLURAL if available).  It's a nice fallback if the
language packs are not installed.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 Constructors

=over 4

=item Log::Report::Translator-E<gt>B<new>(%options)

 -Option  --Default
  charset   <from locale>
  lexicons  <see text>

=over 2

=item charset => STRING

When the locale contains a codeset in its name, then that will be
used.  Otherwise, the default is C<utf-8>.

=item lexicons => DIRECTORY|ARRAY-of-DIRECTORYs

The DIRECTORY where the translations can be found.  See
L<Log::Report::Lexicon::Index|Log::Report::Lexicon::Index> for the expected structure of such
DIRECTORY.

The default is based on the location of the module which instantiates
this translator.  The filename of the module is stripped from its C<.pm>
extension, and used as directory name.  Within that directory, there
must be a directory named C<messages>, which will be the root directory
of a L<Log::Report::Lexicon::Index|Log::Report::Lexicon::Index>.

example: default lexicon directory

 # file xxx/perl5.8.8/My/Module.pm
 use Log::Report 'my-domain'
   , translator => Log::Report::Translator::POT->new;

 # lexicon now in xxx/perl5.8.8/My/Module/messages/

=head2 Accessors

=over 4

=item $obj-E<gt>B<charset>()

Returns the default charset, which can be overrule by the locale.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<lexicons>()

Returns a list of L<Log::Report::Lexicon::Index|Log::Report::Lexicon::Index> objects, where the
translation files may be located.

=back

=head2 Translating

=over 4

=item $obj-E<gt>B<load>($domain, $locale)

Load the translation information in the text $domain for the indicated $locale.
Multiple calls to L<load()|Log::Report::Translator/"Translating"> should not cost significant performance: the
data must be cached.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<translate>( $message, [$language, $ctxt] )

Returns the translation of the $message, a C<Log::Report::Message> object,
based on the current locale.

Translators are permitted to peek into the internal HASH of the
message object, for performance reasons.
